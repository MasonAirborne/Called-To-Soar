    <h3>Life’s Obligation</h3>
    <p>
      There are things in life we often overlook—responsibilities we carry whether we realize it or not. Of course, we know the basics: we’re obligated to work, to treat others with kindness—not for gain or recognition, but because true kindness stems from grace and love. We’re obligated to care for our children, our parents, or, at the very least, ourselves. Wake up, fuel your body, and move with purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there’s another kind of obligation we rarely consider: the obligation to show others what life can be. This is different from your purpose, but deeply connected to it. It affects how you carry yourself and how you wake up each day. People may not think about you as much as you think they do—most are consumed with their own image, their own thoughts. But every decision you make still ripples outward. Marinate on that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to college affects your family emotionally and financially. Landing a job impacts coworkers, friends, even your roommates. Here’s the real kicker: when you better yourself—by waking up, eating healthy, working out—someone is always watching. It could be your niece, your cousin, your friend, or even your parents. When they see your effort, it ignites something in them. That’s the fine line between jealousy and inspiration. “If they can do it, why not me?” It becomes a question of possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yes, you do have an obligation to try your best. Even if your intention is personal growth, you end up elevating everyone around you. You raise the standard. Eventually, your parents are proud. Your friends want to be around your energy. Inspiration is contagious. People—old, young, wise, and lost—watch your steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way you stand in a room. The way you speak. People are drawn to confidence and authenticity. We all want to grow smarter. But if you're the smartest in the room, it’s time to find a new one. Scripture says, "Iron sharpens iron." And "two are better than one—for if one falls, the other can help them up."
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me 25 years and countless hills to climb before I realized they were just preparing me for the mountain. Don’t be discouraged if you haven’t found your place yet. Ecclesiastes reminds us there is a time for everything—a time to laugh, cry, rest, and rejoice. You are not delayed. You're right on time. "Everything works together for the good of those called according to His purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Your gifts may be wisdom, leadership, service, or compassion. We're not all made the same, and that’s the point. Together, we form a beautiful body of believers—lifting each other, inspiring each other, loving deeply. No one should feel unknown in this life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our greatest obligation is to encourage—to show others what is possible. You, too, can experience the love and grace of Jesus Christ. The joy He gave me is available to you. Knock and the door will be opened. Seek and you will find.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this world is filled with cause and effect, why wouldn't there be something greater after this life? If we can see darkness so clearly, then there must be light. Let love and grace carry you forward. Tomorrow, remember this: you’re not just living for yourself—you’re living for those beside you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a healthy race—one where iron sharpens iron and we lift each other up. It’s not about being better than the person next to you. It’s about becoming the runner beside them. Encourage your circle to aim higher. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Science backs it too: dopamine—the brain’s “happy” chemical—is released most when we help others. Service is joy. So wake up and ask not “Why me?” but “Why not me?”
    </p>
    <p><strong>Be better. Be the example. Show others what’s possible through resilience, dedication, and faith.</strong></p>

    <h3 onclick="togglePost(1)">2. A New Perspective on Lessons</h3>
    <article>
      <p>Everyone faces hardships—some that break you, others that build you. Some people shut down, locking their hearts, while others use their wounds to help heal others. Life will always bring challenges, but how we respond is our greatest responsibility.</p>
      <p>Do we shut our doors? Put a lock on them so no one can enter? Or do we leave them cracked open and be discerning with who we allow in? Not everyone is meant to stay, but those who are true friends will walk with you through the hardest seasons.</p>
      <p>We were never meant to tackle life alone. The Bible reminds us: “When two or more are gathered, there I am also.” And again: “Two are better than one—for if one falls, the other can lift them up.” Community matters.</p>
      <p>Life is a series of lessons. Often, the same ones repeat themselves until we finally learn. Ever feel like, “This feels familiar… like something I dealt with two years ago?” That’s not a coincidence. It’s an opportunity to level up—respond differently this time.</p>
      <p>We gravitate toward comfort. But breakthroughs happen when we do the hard things—leave that unfulfilling relationship, run the race, move away from comfort. God doesn’t expect perfection. He wants us to try—to grow and seek Him wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>If life were always smooth, we’d never develop a real relationship with Him. Life is like a heartbeat—constant highs and lows. A flat line means death. We need the lows to appreciate love, gratitude, and community; and we need the highs to experience success and celebration.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, I greeted a stranger with a smile. He stopped to talk. I learned he was picking up his wife from the hospital. My heart dropped. Words failed me. But something nudged me—I turned back. Shaky voice, racing heart—I asked if I could pray for him and his wife. Her name? Same as my mom’s. It felt divine. After a few awkward lines, I turned to leave. He said, “That made my day, ma’am.”</p>
      <p>That’s what life is about. It’s not the job, the car, the clothes. It’s about showing up. Meeting people where they are. Loving them without expectation. God isn’t concerned with your job title—He’s looking at your heart. Are you part of a community that reflects His love?</p>
      <p>If not, maybe it’s time to take courage and seek one. Life isn’t about climbing your mountain alone—it’s about climbing together. That takes courage. And the most courageous decisions often lead to the most fulfilling outcomes.</p>
