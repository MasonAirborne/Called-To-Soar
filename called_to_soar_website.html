    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="/mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-07-29 at 4.19.44 PM.jpeg" alt="May childhood photo" class="profile">
    <p>I never imagined that all those childhood flights across state lines would lead me here—chasing the skies not as a passenger, but as a pilot. My path to aviation didn’t start in a straight line, but in many ways, it was preparing me all along. I didn’t sit in the cockpit until I was 22, but the seed had been planted long before. After years of exploring different paths, I finally committed myself to flying at 26. It wasn’t a sudden leap, but a decision shaped by years of perseverance, sacrifice, and growth.</p>
    <p>In 2021, I graduated from my dream school—the University of Tennessee—with a degree in Business and a minor in Marketing. I was a first-generation college student who transferred from a community college where I played collegiate basketball. My team, a true Cinderella story, went all the way to the Tennessee state championship and lost in a grueling triple-overtime game. That loss taught me resilience. I went on to complete my degree debt-free, after working tirelessly, applying for scholarships, attending summer school, and spending nights in the library until midnight. I learned the value of showing up consistently—even when the odds were stacked against me.</p>
    <p>After saving over $20,000 for flight school and another $30,000 for retirement, I quit a stable but unfulfilling job to pursue flying full-time. I now have 20 hours of flight time, study four to five hours daily, and fly two hours a day. Recently, I became a part-time airside assistant at my local Class C airport to immerse myself in the operational side of aviation. Whether it’s assisting aircraft in extreme weather or helping maintain ramp safety, I take pride in doing the "grunt work" that keeps aviation moving.</p>
    <p>Still, there are days I battle self-doubt. I ask myself, “Why didn’t I do this sooner?” But then I remind myself—every year of preparation mattered. Every struggle gave me grit. My journey wasn’t delayed; it was fortified. I’ve learned to give myself grace. I am not behind—I am right on time.</p>
    <p>Now, at 27, I see a bigger purpose beyond my own dream. I mentor a young woman who wants to become a pilot. Sharing my experiences, the lessons I wish I knew, and seeing her eyes light up reminds me that this journey is not just about me. It’s about breaking barriers, shattering ceilings, and showing the next generation what’s possible.</p>

    <h2>Faith Journey</h2>
    <p>My faith journey has been filled with ups and downs. I always knew Jesus, but my first true encounter with Him came after my parents' divorce. Even though I drifted in my early adult years—partying, drinking, and smoking—He met me again in my despair in 2022. It was then I heard His voice say, “Look up child, you are forgiven. Follow Me and you will be saved.”</p>
    <p>That moment felt like a breath of fresh air. Since then, my walk with God has been a daily choice. It’s not always easy—but it’s always worth it. I choose to follow my Savior, to love people radically, to be kind, and to stay joyful no matter what challenges I face. Every day I choose to walk in light, purpose, and grace.</p>
