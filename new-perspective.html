    <h2>A New Perspective on Lessons</h2>
    <p>Everyone faces hardships—some that break you, others that build you. Some people shut down, locking their hearts, while others use their wounds to help heal others. Life will always bring challenges, but how we respond is our greatest responsibility.</p>
    <p>Do we shut our doors? Put a lock on them so no one can enter? Or do we leave them cracked open and be discerning with who we allow in? Not everyone is meant to stay, but those who are true friends will walk with you through the hardest seasons.</p>
    <p>We were never meant to tackle life alone. The Bible reminds us: “When two or more are gathered, there I am also.” And again: “Two are better than one—for if one falls, the other can lift them up.” Community matters.</p>
    <p>Life is a series of lessons. Often, the same ones repeat themselves until we finally learn. Ever feel like, “This feels familiar… like something I dealt with two years ago?” That’s not a coincidence. It’s an opportunity to level up—respond differently this time.</p>
    <p>We gravitate toward comfort. But breakthroughs happen when we do the hard things—leave that unfulfilling relationship, run the race, move away from comfort. God doesn’t expect perfection. He wants us to try—to grow and seek Him wholeheartedly.</p>
    <p>If life were always smooth, we’d never develop a real relationship with Him. Life is like a heartbeat—constant highs and lows. A flat line means death. We need the lows to appreciate love, gratitude, and community; and we need the highs to experience success and celebration.</p>
    <p>Earlier today, I greeted a stranger with a smile. He stopped to talk. I learned he was picking up his wife from the hospital. My heart dropped. Words failed me. But something nudged me—I turned back. Shaky voice, racing heart—I asked if I could pray for him and his wife. Her name? Same as my mom’s. It felt divine. After a few awkward lines, I turned to leave. He said, “That made my day, ma’am.”</p>
    <p>That’s what life is about. It’s not the job, the car, the clothes. It’s about showing up. Meeting people where they are. Loving them without expectation. God isn’t concerned with your job title—He’s looking at your heart. Are you part of a community that reflects His love?</p>
    <p>If not, maybe it’s time to take courage and seek one. Life isn’t about climbing your mountain alone—it’s about climbing together. That takes courage. And the most courageous decisions often lead to the most fulfilling outcomes.</p>
