  <h2>Flight Goals & Funding</h2>
  <p>
    My dream is to become a professional corporate pilot—flying King Airs, Pilatus PC-24s, and Gulfstreams across the country and globe. 
    But dreams like this require more than passion — they require funding, commitment, and faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve already saved over $20,000 toward training and work full-time at a Class C airport to stay immersed in aviation. 
    But advanced ratings like my Instrument, Commercial, and Multi-Engine still cost tens of thousands more. 
    My total financial goal is approximately <strong>$60,000</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve applied to several aviation scholarships including:
    <ul>
      <li>Women in Aviation International</li>
      <li>Women in Corporate Aviation</li>
      <li>The Part-Time Pilot Flight Scholarship</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Every bit of support counts — financially, emotionally, or spiritually.
