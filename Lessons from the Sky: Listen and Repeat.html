    <h1>Lessons from the Sky: Listen and Repeat ✈️</h1>
    <p class="meta">Sept 16 2025 • ~3 min read</p>

    <p>
      Right now, I’m at a stumbling block—it feels like I’m the only one struggling. 
      My home airport is a little Class G, untowered strip. But my training has moved me 
      into the “big leagues”: Class C, towered airspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      That first flight into controlled airspace? Let me tell you—it felt like trying to 
      speak a foreign language. The tower rattled off instructions, and I barely understood 
      a word. Second lesson? Not much better. Third lesson? I’ll admit it: I cried on the 
      drive home. The thought hit me hard—<em>Am I really putting everything I’ve got into 
      this dream? Will I ever make it through this dark tunnel?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the week, I asked other pilots for advice. I picked up little tips, insider 
      knowledge, encouragement. One guy told me, <q>You’re overcomplicating it—the tower works 
      for you. Just repeat what they say back.</q>  
      <br>Well, thanks Todd, but it’s not that easy!
    </p>

    <p>And yet—maybe it is.</p>

    <p>
      Because isn’t life exactly like this? We overcomplicate things. We hear what people say, 
      but we don’t always listen. We don’t always register it. My parents, grandparents, 
      friends—they’ll tell me: “You’re doing great, May.” “I’m proud of you.” 
      “Your work ethic is amazing.” <br>
      And what’s my default response? <em>Yeah, yeah, thanks.</em> I shrug it off like static 
      on the radio.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The solution? Listen and repeat. Don’t just let words pass through—read them back, 
      let them register, let them sink in.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Because the truth is: you <strong>are</strong> doing great. You <strong>are</strong> working 
      toward something incredibly difficult. And it shows—because you’re showing up. Most people 
      don’t even get that far.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flying into a towered airport requires you to repeat back every instruction so you can 
      process it, confirm it, and believe it. Life works the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what truths are you ignoring? What encouragement have you brushed aside instead of 
      reading back into your own heart? Next time someone affirms you, don’t dismiss it—say it back. 
      Believe it. Live it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because sometimes the clearest lessons come not from the ground, but from the sky.
