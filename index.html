    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>For years, I dreaded the classic questions:</p>
    <p><em>“So… what do you want to be when you grow up?”</em><br><em>“What are you doing these days?”</em></p>
    <p>Now, I finally have an answer I can say with absolute confidence:<br><strong>I’m becoming a pilot.</strong></p>

    <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
    <p>My path to aviation wasn’t straight. I didn’t set foot in a cockpit until I was 22. But the seed had been planted long before that—and at 26, I finally made the decision.</p>
    <p>Not a leap. A decision. Born out of grit, sacrifice, and years of quiet perseverance. On July 16, 2025, with 27 hours logged, I completed my first solo flight. That’s when the journey to SOAR truly began.</p>

    <h2>Resilience Built on the Ground</h2>
    <p>As a first-generation college graduate, I earned my business degree in 2021 debt-free.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>25+ scholarships</li>
      <li>Summers packed with classes</li>
      <li>Countless late nights in the library</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That season taught me discipline, resilience, and the value of showing up—even when the odds aren’t in your favor.</p>

    <h2>The Pivot Point</h2>
    <p>After years of draining jobs, I decided to start where I was with what I had. I got a job at my local Class Charlie airport. Today, I’m in the thick of corporate aviation: fueling, marshaling, battling extreme weather, and learning how the industry moves.</p>
    <p>Every time I watch a pilot—especially a woman—step off a Pilatus PC-24, King Air, or Gulfstream, it reignites my purpose: <strong>I will be one of them.</strong></p>

    <h2>What I’ve Learned</h2>
    <p>I’ve had my share of doubts. “Why didn’t I start sooner?” or "Am I good enough?" But I’ve learned that every year of waiting was building something in me. Every delay fortified my character. My journey wasn’t late—it was right on time.</p>

    <h2>Why I Share This</h2>
    <p>Aviation isn’t just a dream to me. It’s a responsibility. It demands safety, judgment, and professionalism. And this is my invitation to you:</p>
    <p><strong>Stop asking, “Why me?”<br>Start declaring, “Why not me?”</strong></p>
