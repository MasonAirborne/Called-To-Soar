    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="mission">
      I’m Mason Airborne — a determined, full-of-life adventurer with a love for flight, people, and the thrill of the unknown.
      My mission is to inspire others to chase the dreams that scare them, and to prove that the leap of faith is worth it.

      <p>"<strong>Why NOT me?</strong>" — That’s the question I live by.</p>
      <p>I’ve never been the type to sit still or play it safe. From catching waves on a surfboard to fueling jets on the ramp, I’ve always chased that heart-racing mix of awe and calm that comes from embracing the unknown.</p>
      <p>I didn’t step into a cockpit until I was 22 — but when I did, I felt the same rush I used to get from the ocean, only this time, it was God’s creation stretched out beneath me.</p>
      <p>I worked my way through college debt-free, juggling multiple jobs while leaning on the incredible support of my family. Basketball taught me grit, leadership, and dedication; life taught me resilience, hustle, and faith.</p>
      <p>Now, my dream is to become a corporate pilot — flying sleek jets across the skies, inspiring the underdog, and proving that no dream is too bold if you’re willing to put in the work.</p>
      <p>If I can make one person believe in themselves — or even just smile in a day — I’ve succeeded.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>My dream is to become a professional corporate pilot — flying jets like the Gulfstream, Bombardier, or Dassault. I’ve already saved over $20,000 and completed my first solo flight, but I still need funding for the rest of my ratings.</p>
    <p>I’m actively applying for scholarships and working at a busy Class C airport to make my dream a reality. Every hour, every application, and every flight gets me closer to inspiring others to chase their boldest dreams.</p>
