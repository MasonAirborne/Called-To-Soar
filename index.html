    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="mission">
      I’m Mason Airborne — a determined, full-of-life adventurer with a love for flight, people, and the thrill of the unknown.
      My mission is to inspire others to chase the dreams that scare them, and to prove that the leap of faith is worth it.

    <p>After years of uncertainty and dodging the classic holiday questions—“What do you want to be when you grow up?” or “What are you doing these days?”—I finally have an answer I can say with confidence: I'm becoming a pilot.</p>
    <p>My path to aviation wasn’t linear, but in many ways, it was building in the background all along. I didn’t set foot in a cockpit until I was 22, but the dream had been planted years earlier. At 26, I made the commitment. On July 16th, 2025, I completed my first solo flight with 27 hours logged. That’s when the journey to SOAR truly began.</p>
    <p>As a first-generation college student, I earned my business degree in 2021—completely debt-free. I applied to over 25 scholarships, enrolled in summer courses, and spent countless nights in the library. That experience taught me resilience, discipline, and the value of showing up even when the odds aren’t in your favor.</p>
    <p>I thrive on adventure, new challenges, and connecting with people. From surfing waves to flying above the clouds, I chase that feeling of awe that reminds me of God’s incredible creation. My grandparents’ unwavering belief in me has shaped my path, and now I want to pass that same encouragement to others who question themselves the way I once did.</p>
    <p>If I can make one person smile or believe in their own dream each day, I’ve succeeded.</p>
