    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="IMG_0234.JPG" alt="May Airborne" class="about-photo">
    <p><strong>Mason Airborne —</strong><br>
    With years of searching and getting tired of answering the dreadful question every holiday season from family I can confidently answer “What do you want to be when you grow up” or “what are you doing for work these days”. My path to aviation didn’t start in a straight line, but in many ways, it was preparing me all along. I didn’t sit in the cockpit until I was 22, but the seed had been planted long before. After years of exploring different paths, I finally committed myself to flying at 26. It wasn’t a sudden leap, but a decision shaped by years of perseverance, sacrifice, and growth. July 16th of 2025 I completed my first solo with 27 logged hours and the journey to SOAR began!</p>
    <p>As a First-Generation college student I earned my business degree in 2021, debt-free, after applying to over 25 scholarships, taking summer classes, and spending countless nights in the library. These experiences shaped my discipline, courage, and resilience—traits I now bring to my training. I learned the value of showing up consistently—even when the odds were stacked against me.</p>
    <p>After years of unfulfilling jobs and the grueling holiday small talk, I made a commitment to myself. Start NOW! For me that was getting a job at my local airport. I am currently immersed in the corporate sector of a Class Charlie. Whether it’s assisting aircraft in extreme weather or helping maintain ramp safety, I take pride in doing the "grunt work" that keeps aviation moving. It gives me purpose and motivation. When I see pilots, especially women, step off these Pilatus PC-24, KingAirs and even Gulfstreams—it lights a fire under my butt. The determination to fly corporate and that feeling of having a flashback to today will be surreal.</p>
    <p>Still, there are days I battle self-doubt. I ask myself, “Why didn’t I do this sooner?” But then I remind myself—every year of preparation matters. Every struggle gave me grit. My journey wasn’t delayed; it was fortified. I’ve learned to give myself grace. I am not behind—I am right on time. Flying isn’t just a dream for me—it’s a responsibility. My daily training reinforces that aviation is not just about skill, but about safety, sound judgment, and professionalism—values I uphold on every flight and every shift on the ramp. I’m proud to be learning aviation from the ground up, experiencing every layer of what makes this industry thrive.</p>

      <h3>Life’s Obligation</h3>
      <p>There are things in life we often overlook—responsibilities we carry whether we realize it or not. Of course, we know the basics: we’re obligated to work, to treat others with kindness—not for gain or recognition, but because true kindness stems from grace and love. We’re obligated to care for our children, our parents, or, at the very least, ourselves. Wake up, fuel your body, and move with purpose.</p>
      <p>But there’s another kind of obligation we rarely consider: the obligation to show others what life can be. This is different from your purpose, but deeply connected to it. It affects how you carry yourself and how you wake up each day. People may not think about you as much as you think they do—most are consumed with their own image, their own thoughts. But every decision you make still ripples outward. Marinate on that.</p>
      <p>Going to college affects your family emotionally and financially. Landing a job impacts coworkers, friends, even your roommates. Here’s the real kicker: when you better yourself—by waking up, eating healthy, working out—someone is always watching. It could be your niece, your cousin, your friend, or even your parents. When they see your effort, it ignites something in them. That’s the fine line between jealousy and inspiration. “If they can do it, why not me?” It becomes a question of possibility.</p>
      <p>So yes, you do have an obligation to try your best. Even if your intention is personal growth, you end up elevating everyone around you. You raise the standard. Eventually, your parents are proud. Your friends want to be around your energy. Inspiration is contagious. People—old, young, wise, and lost—watch your steps.</p>
      <p>The way you stand in a room. The way you speak. People are drawn to confidence and authenticity. We all want to grow smarter. But if you're the smartest in the room, it’s time to find a new one. Scripture says, "Iron sharpens iron." And "two are better than one—for if one falls, the other can help them up."</p>
      <p>It took me 25 years and countless hills to climb before I realized they were just preparing me for the mountain. Don’t be discouraged if you haven’t found your place yet. Ecclesiastes reminds us there is a time for everything—a time to laugh, cry, rest, and rejoice. You are not delayed. You're right on time. "Everything works together for the good of those called according to His purpose."</p>
      <p>Your gifts may be wisdom, leadership, service, or compassion. We're not all made the same, and that’s the point. Together, we form a beautiful body of believers—lifting each other, inspiring each other, loving deeply. No one should feel unknown in this life.</p>
      <p>Our greatest obligation is to encourage—to show others what is possible. You, too, can experience the love and grace of Jesus Christ. The joy He gave me is available to you. Knock and the door will be opened. Seek and you will find.</p>
      <p>If this world is filled with cause and effect, why wouldn't there be something greater after this life? If we can see darkness so clearly, then there must be light. Let love and grace carry you forward. Tomorrow, remember this: you’re not just living for yourself—you’re living for those beside you.</p>
      <p>This is a healthy race—one where iron sharpens iron and we lift each other up. It’s not about being better than the person next to you. It’s about becoming the runner beside them. Encourage your circle to aim higher.</p>
      <p>Science backs it too: dopamine—the brain’s “happy” chemical—is released most when we help others. Service is joy. So wake up and ask not “Why me?” but “Why not me?”</p>
      <p><strong>Be better. Be the example. Show others what’s possible through resilience, dedication, and faith.</strong></p>
