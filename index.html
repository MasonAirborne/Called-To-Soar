    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-highlight">
      <p>"<strong>Why NOT me?</strong>" — That’s the question I live by.</p>
      <p>I’ve never been the type to sit still or play it safe. From catching waves on a surfboard to fueling jets on the ramp, I’ve always chased that heart-racing mix of awe and calm that comes from embracing the unknown.</p>
      <p>I didn’t step into a cockpit until I was 22 — but when I did, I felt the same rush I used to get from the ocean, only this time, it was God’s creation stretched out beneath me.</p>
      <p>I worked my way through college debt-free, juggling multiple jobs while leaning on the incredible support of my family. Basketball taught me grit, leadership, and dedication; life taught me resilience, hustle, and faith.</p>
      <p>Now, my dream is to become a corporate pilot — flying sleek jets across the skies, inspiring the underdog, and proving that no dream is too bold if you’re willing to put in the work.</p>
      <p>If I can make one person believe in themselves — or even just smile in a day — I’ve succeeded.</p>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>My dream is to become a professional corporate pilot — flying jets like the Gulfstream, Bombardier, or Dassault. I’ve already saved over $20,000 and completed my first solo flight, but I still need funding for the rest of my ratings.</p>
    <p>I’m actively applying for scholarships and working at a busy Class C airport to make my dream a reality. Every hour, every application, and every flight gets me closer to inspiring others to chase their boldest dreams.</p>
