    <h2>My Flight Training Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My dream is to become a professional <strong>corporate pilot</strong> — flying King Airs, Pilatus PC-24s, and Gulfstreams across the country and globe. But dreams like this require more than passion — they require funding, commitment, and faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve already saved over <strong>$20,000</strong> toward training and another <strong>$30,000</strong> toward my future. I’ve completed my first solo flight and work part-time at a busy Class C airport to stay immersed in the industry. But advanced ratings like my Instrument, Commercial, and Multi-Engine cost tens of thousands more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My total financial goal for flight training is approximately <strong>$60,000</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m actively applying to multiple aviation scholarships including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Women in Aviation International (WAI)</li>
      <li>Women in Corporate Aviation</li>
      <li>The Part-Time Pilot Flight Scholarship</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each scholarship gets me one step closer to fulfilling my mission: becoming a CFI, flying corporate, and mentoring the next generation of underrepresented aviators. Your support — whether through sharing my story or contributing directly — helps me stay in the sky and on purpose.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Together, we’re proving that hard work and faith can take you anywhere — even 36,000 feet in the air.</strong></p>
