  <h2>My Flight Training Goals</h2>
  <p>
    My dream is to become a professional <strong>corporate pilot</strong> — flying jets like the Gulfstream, Bombardier, or Dassault across the skies. It’s not just about the aircraft — it’s about reaching people, building a legacy, and breaking barriers in aviation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working full-time at a busy Class C airport, gaining hands-on experience in operations and fueling my passion for aviation daily. I’ve already saved over <strong>$20,000</strong> toward flight school and recently completed my first solo flight — a milestone that marked the beginning of my path to the skies.
  </p>
  <p>
    But becoming a pilot requires more than passion — it takes funding, focus, and perseverance. The cost of my remaining ratings (Instrument, Commercial, Multi-Engine) adds up quickly. My overall fundraising goal is approximately <strong>$60,000</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm actively applying for aviation scholarships, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Women in Aviation International (WAI)</li>
    <li>Women in Corporate Aviation</li>
    <li>The Part-Time Pilot Flight Scholarship</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each application, each flight hour, each shift at the airport brings me closer to a future where I can inspire others to follow their dreams — especially young women and underrepresented aspiring aviators.
