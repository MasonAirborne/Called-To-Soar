 <p>There are things in life we often overlook—responsibilities we carry whether we realize it or not. Of course, we know the basics: we’re obligated to work, to treat others with kindness—not for gain or recognition, but because true kindness stems from grace and love. We’re obligated to care for our children, our parents, or at the very least, ourselves. Wake up, fuel your body, and move with purpose.</p>

    <p>But there’s another kind of obligation we rarely consider: the obligation to show others what life can be. This is different from your purpose, though deeply connected to it. It influences how you carry yourself, how you approach each day, and how others experience you. People may not think about you as much as you imagine—most are consumed with their own lives and worries. But every decision you make still ripples outward.</p>

    <p>Going to college affects your family emotionally and financially. Landing a job impacts coworkers, friends, even your roommates. Here’s the real kicker: when you better yourself—by waking up, eating healthy, working out—someone is always watching. It might be your niece, your cousin, your friend, or even your parents. When they see your effort, it ignites something in them. That’s the fine line between jealousy and inspiration. <em>“If they can do it, why not me?”</em> It becomes a question of possibility.</p>

    <p>So yes, you do have an obligation to try your best. Even when your focus is on personal growth, you elevate everyone around you. You raise the standard. Eventually, your parents beam with pride, your friends crave your energy, and strangers feel inspired. Inspiration is contagious. People—young or old, wise or lost—are watching your steps.</p>

    <p>The way you stand in a room. The way you speak. The quiet strength of authenticity. We are drawn to confidence and truth. And while we all want to grow wiser, if you’re the smartest in the room, it’s time to find a new one.</p>

    <blockquote>“Iron sharpens iron.” <br> “Two are better than one—for if one falls, the other can help them up.”</blockquote>

    <p>It took me 25 years and countless hills to climb before I realized they were only preparing me for the mountain. Don’t be discouraged if you haven’t found your place yet. Ecclesiastes reminds us there is a time for everything—a time to laugh, cry, rest, and rejoice. You are not delayed. You’re right on time. <em>“Everything works together for the good of those called according to His purpose.”</em></p>

    <p>Your gifts may be wisdom, leadership, service, or compassion. We’re not all made the same, and that’s the beauty of it. Together, we form a body of believers—lifting, inspiring, and loving one another. No one should feel unseen in this life.</p>

    <p>Our greatest obligation is to encourage—to show others what’s possible. You, too, can experience the love and grace of Jesus Christ. The joy He gave me is available to you. Knock, and the door will be opened. Seek, and you will find.</p>

    <p>If this world is filled with cause and effect, why wouldn’t there be something greater after this life? If we can see darkness so clearly, then surely there must be light. Let love and grace carry you forward. Tomorrow, remember this: you’re not just living for yourself—you’re living for those beside you.</p>

    <p>This is a healthy race—one where iron sharpens iron and we lift each other up. It’s not about being better than the person next to you. It’s about running alongside them. Encourage your circle to aim higher.</p>

    <p>Science agrees: dopamine—the brain’s “happy” chemical—is released most when we help others. Service is joy. So wake up and ask not, <em>“Why me?”</em> but <em>“Why not me?”</em></p>

    <p><strong>Be better. Be the example. Show others what’s possible through resilience, dedication, and faith.</strong></p>
